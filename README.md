# VSCode LiveCode Extension

A basic Visual Studio Code extension that allows other programmers to follow along as I code. 

When activated, this extension pushes all saved code changes to a [LiveCode](https://livecode.codeadam.ca/) API. Files are made available to followers in plain text to allow for easy reading and copying and pasting during streaming.
